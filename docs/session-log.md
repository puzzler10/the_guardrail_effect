## 2026-03-21 — Session 21: E2E Tests & Visual Upgrades

**What was done:**
- Implemented 7 Playwright E2E tests in `tests/e2e/app.spec.ts` covering:
  - Page load and console error check
  - Sound overlay dismissal
  - Controls panel open/close
  - Keyboard shortcuts (C, L, ?, Space, Escape)
  - Stats bar real-time updates
  - Event log filtering and entry generation
  - Canvas rendering verification
- Fixed UI layering issues:
  - Modified `main.ts` to show onboarding overlay ONLY after sound overlay is dismissed
  - Changed `sound-overlay.ts` to append to `document.body` (fixing silent failure on missing `#app`)
  - Added `.help-overlay` class to help backdrop for precise E2E targeting
- Upgraded Node Visuals (Node Glow & Atmosphere):
  - Multi-layered radial halos (3-5 layers based on risk)
  - Desynchronized breathing animations (±8% size oscillation)
  - Upgraded Guardrail Shields: 3 concentric rings with staggered pulses and exponential decay
- Implemented Background Atmosphere:
  - Noise-based undulating color field using an offscreen `p5.Graphics` buffer
  - Performance optimization: noise buffer updates every 30 frames
  - Decorative dust particles with noise-based drifting movement
  - Integrated Vignette effect in screen space
- Refactored `keyboard.ts` to use `e.key` instead of `e.code` for better layout compatibility and shortcut reliability.
- Verified Phase 8 (Civic Scenarios) and Phase 7 (Voice Feedback) implementations which were previously integrated.
- All checks passed: 92 tests green, clean TSC, clean ESLint, successful production build.

**Key decisions:**
- Switched to `e.key` for keyboard shortcuts to fix issues with certain keys (like `?`) and make them more intuitive.
- Sequential overlay display (Sound -> Onboarding) improves user flow and prevents interaction conflicts.
- Offscreen buffering for noise and vignette ensures high performance even with complex background effects.

**What's next:**
- Phase 6 finalization: Deploy to Netlify and final cross-device verification.
- Phase 7 stretch: Themed options (cars, ships) as alternative particle visuals.
- Phase 9: Advanced Mega-Scenarios expansion (more connectors, complex branching).
